# Extending OpenAPI { #extending-openapi }

There are some cases where you might need to modify the generated OpenAPI schema.

In this section you will see how.

## The normal process { #the-normal-process }

The normal (default) process, is as follows.

A `FastAPI` application (instance) has an `.openapi()` method that is expected to return the OpenAPI schema.

As part of the application object creation, a *path operation* for `/openapi.json` (or for whatever you set your `openapi_url`) is registered.

It just returns a JSON response with the result of the application's `.openapi()` method.

By default, what the method `.openapi()` does is check the property `.openapi_schema` to see if it has contents and return them.

If it doesn't, it generates them using the utility function at `fastapi.openapi.utils.get_openapi`.

And that function `get_openapi()` receives as parameters:

* `title`: The OpenAPI title, shown in the docs.
* `version`: The version of your API, e.g. `2.5.0`.
* `openapi_version`: The version of the OpenAPI specification used. By default, the latest: `3.1.0`.
* `summary`: A short summary of the API.
* `description`: The description of your API, this can include markdown and will be shown in the docs.
* `routes`: The routes from the application, taken from `app.routes`. FastAPI uses them to collect the registered *path operations*, including those from included routers.

/// tip | Technical Details

`app.routes` is a lower-level route tree. It can include route candidates that FastAPI uses internally for included routers, not only final `APIRoute` objects.

You can still pass `app.routes` to `get_openapi()`. FastAPI will traverse that route tree to collect the effective path operations.

///

/// note

The parameter `summary` is available in OpenAPI 3.1.0 and above, supported by FastAPI 0.99.0 and above.

///

## Overriding the defaults { #overriding-the-defaults }

Using the information above, you can use the same utility function to generate the OpenAPI schema and override each part that you need.

For example, let's add [ReDoc's OpenAPI extension to include a custom logo](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc/blob/main/docs/redoc-vendor-extensions.md#x-logo).

### Normal **FastAPI** { #normal-fastapi }

First, write all your **FastAPI** application as normally:

```python
# tutorial001_py310.py
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.openapi.utils import get_openapi

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/items/")
async def read_items():
    return [{"name": "Foo"}]


def custom_openapi():
    if app.openapi_schema:
        return app.openapi_schema
    openapi_schema = get_openapi(
        title="Custom title",
        version="2.5.0",
        summary="This is a very custom OpenAPI schema",
        description="Here's a longer description of the custom **OpenAPI** schema",
        routes=app.routes,
    )
    openapi_schema["info"]["x-logo"] = {
        "url": "https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/logo-margin/logo-teal.png"
    }
    app.openapi_schema = openapi_schema
    return app.openapi_schema


app.openapi = custom_openapi
```
### Generate the OpenAPI schema { #generate-the-openapi-schema }

Then, use the same utility function to generate the OpenAPI schema, inside a `custom_openapi()` function:

```python
# tutorial001_py310.py
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.openapi.utils import get_openapi

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/items/")
async def read_items():
    return [{"name": "Foo"}]


def custom_openapi():
    if app.openapi_schema:
        return app.openapi_schema
    openapi_schema = get_openapi(
        title="Custom title",
        version="2.5.0",
        summary="This is a very custom OpenAPI schema",
        description="Here's a longer description of the custom **OpenAPI** schema",
        routes=app.routes,
    )
    openapi_schema["info"]["x-logo"] = {
        "url": "https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/logo-margin/logo-teal.png"
    }
    app.openapi_schema = openapi_schema
    return app.openapi_schema


app.openapi = custom_openapi
```
### Modify the OpenAPI schema { #modify-the-openapi-schema }

Now you can add the ReDoc extension, adding a custom `x-logo` to the `info` "object" in the OpenAPI schema:

```python
# tutorial001_py310.py
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.openapi.utils import get_openapi

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/items/")
async def read_items():
    return [{"name": "Foo"}]


def custom_openapi():
    if app.openapi_schema:
        return app.openapi_schema
    openapi_schema = get_openapi(
        title="Custom title",
        version="2.5.0",
        summary="This is a very custom OpenAPI schema",
        description="Here's a longer description of the custom **OpenAPI** schema",
        routes=app.routes,
    )
    openapi_schema["info"]["x-logo"] = {
        "url": "https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/logo-margin/logo-teal.png"
    }
    app.openapi_schema = openapi_schema
    return app.openapi_schema


app.openapi = custom_openapi
```
### Cache the OpenAPI schema { #cache-the-openapi-schema }

You can use the property `.openapi_schema` as a "cache", to store your generated schema.

That way, your application won't have to generate the schema every time a user opens your API docs.

It will be generated only once, and then the same cached schema will be used for the next requests.

```python
# tutorial001_py310.py
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.openapi.utils import get_openapi

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/items/")
async def read_items():
    return [{"name": "Foo"}]


def custom_openapi():
    if app.openapi_schema:
        return app.openapi_schema
    openapi_schema = get_openapi(
        title="Custom title",
        version="2.5.0",
        summary="This is a very custom OpenAPI schema",
        description="Here's a longer description of the custom **OpenAPI** schema",
        routes=app.routes,
    )
    openapi_schema["info"]["x-logo"] = {
        "url": "https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/logo-margin/logo-teal.png"
    }
    app.openapi_schema = openapi_schema
    return app.openapi_schema


app.openapi = custom_openapi
```
### Override the method { #override-the-method }

Now you can replace the `.openapi()` method with your new function.

```python
# tutorial001_py310.py
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.openapi.utils import get_openapi

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/items/")
async def read_items():
    return [{"name": "Foo"}]


def custom_openapi():
    if app.openapi_schema:
        return app.openapi_schema
    openapi_schema = get_openapi(
        title="Custom title",
        version="2.5.0",
        summary="This is a very custom OpenAPI schema",
        description="Here's a longer description of the custom **OpenAPI** schema",
        routes=app.routes,
    )
    openapi_schema["info"]["x-logo"] = {
        "url": "https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/logo-margin/logo-teal.png"
    }
    app.openapi_schema = openapi_schema
    return app.openapi_schema


app.openapi = custom_openapi
```
### Check it { #check-it }

Once you go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc](http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc) you will see that you are using your custom logo (in this example, **FastAPI**'s logo):
